Basic C++ SDL2 Game Engine

Basic usage:
In main.cpp, create a class which inherates `ExecutableClass`, define the virtual public method `void mainloop` with what you want to happen in mainloop. Basic functions include `create_sprite` and `create_sprite_with_velocity`. Along with this definition, you must also define the `windowManager` pointer to a new `WindowManager`
